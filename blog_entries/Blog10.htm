<h2>Week 10 - Final Phase of Project and the course</h2>
<p>We are nearing the final phase of the project and the course. Last week has been super hectic and fun. Did lots of experiments on server side controls. 
Grid View, Data list, List View, Repeater and what not.I am using all of these server side controls in my project. My project is shaping up well. </p>

<p>
The only bad thing which happened last week is, my database starts to throw some weird stating that there is no space available when I try to upload data. Now, this error has consumed a lot of time, last week. My database consumes less than 10 MB, but still I see this error .  I have emailed the professor on Wednesday and waiting for his reply , for further instructions. I will be bummed if this error would make me change my project design. I hope this gets sorted out quickly. Keeping my fingers crossed, as I step into the most important phase of this course.
