<h2>Week 9-11/17- Chicken Pox Weeks</h2>
<p>Last 2 weeks have to be the worst weeks I have ever had in the USA. On Nov7th, symptoms of chicken pox started in me and on Nov9th , it was confirmed that I got infected with chickenpox virus but the doctors 

were unsure whether it was Measles/chicken pox. Nevertheless, it ruined my schedule for the next 2 weeks.My doctor advised me to take rest for 2 weeks.  I was barely able to work on these 2 weeks . My experiements, 

projects , infact my entire graduate life came to a standstill for 2 weeks. Ok, Now, enough of the rant. </p>

<h3>Web Development Progress</h3>
<p>Today , I write this,having recovered 90% from that awful virus , hoping to pace up everything that has stagnated in the last 2 weeks. I started with my experiments yesterday and have completed 6 experiments , as of 

now. I have revamped my homepage completely. It has a totally new look , compared to what I've had in the past. Interesting design ideas are coming to my mind for the home page design but I have to focus on my project 

which is nearing its deadline.</p>
<p>Today,an interesting idea struck me while pondering new ideas for my project. I am thinking about adding a feature that displays some list of crops , along with their pictures, and lets the user to select any of these crops. 

I am in a dilemma on how to retrieve the images of crops . Initially I thought of storing the images in an online image hosting service and saving only the image id in my database. Now, I am more inclined towards storing and 

retrieving the image from a DB. The caveat with the latter approach is the time it would take to render 10-15 images from the database. Tomorrow, I am planning to conduct some experiments to check both these options, 

Based on the results, I will have to design my project.</p>
<p>Gotta catch up the 2 weeks that I lost to chicken pox. </p>
