<h2>Week 5 : MEAN Stack !!!!</h2>

<p>This course never ceases to amaze me. This is my third week into Web Dev and every week so far has only left me longing to  spend more time in learning a technology deeper. There is so much to learn from this course and yet I am not able to allot as much as time I would want to. Bummer.</p>

<p>This week we got introduced to MEAN Stack. An awesome technology stack which uses Javascript from frontend to server to DB. I've not been much of a fan of Javascript but with the things I have been introduced in this course , I am transitioning into a fan of Javascript.</p>


<p>
    This week , I spent almost 30 hours on experiments , trying to implement the MEAN stack completely. Though Prof.Annunziato is yet to show us how to connect to the mongo DB hosted in open shift, I tried to figure it out myself just to complete the MEAN application that I started. But , unfortunately , I have not been able to figure out how to connect to mongo DB using Rock Mongo. Still, with the front and server end design of my MEAN application ready , I can positive that I can complete my MEAN application soon , once Prof shows us how to connect to Mongo DB hosted in Open shift.

<p>Another good thing that happened this week , was the video recordings that Professor has started to post online . It is super helpful while doing experiments and it really makes us understand the concepts clearly by revisiting professor's lectures. I hope the professor continues to do this throughout the semester. </p>
