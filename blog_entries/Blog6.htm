<h2>Week 8</h2>

<p>I proposed 3 project ideas to Prof. Annunziato and finally zeroed in on the project that helps farmers in making their farming decisions. The project looks challenging, a bit intimidating but nevertheless this is the one that piques curiosity in me and has scope for scaling up in the future. The idea I have is abstract and has the potential to take multiple shapes from here. So, I have to make sure that I implement the key features that will really assist farmers in making their agricultural decisions.</p>

<p> I have started experimenting on fetching the required data for my project.  The US Department of Agriculture's Quick Stats API , Agriculture Market Service API , USDA's Economic Research API , World Weather Online API are some of the APIs that I have explored and planning to use in my project.</p>

This week, I experimented on connecting to SQL DB and it has cost me a lot of time and problems. Initially I connected to the DB from the CCIS lab machine and inserted data into my DB, but later when I try to access the DB from my laptop , it wont connect. I struggled with it for almost 10 hours and nothing has worked so far. 

Here is a <a href="https://piazza.com/class/hzjweqipsld4r4?cid=81">piazza post </a>that describes the issue that I have been having with the DB. I am planning to meet Prof.Rasala or Prof Annunziato to get this issue sorted out. Hopefully this gets resolved soon and doesn't hinder my progress in my project , significantly.
