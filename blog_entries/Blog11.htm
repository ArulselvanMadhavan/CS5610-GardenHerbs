<h2>Final Week</h2>

<p>
I couldn't get the database size increased. So , I started clearing up unwanted stuff from my DB. Had set up 2 meetings with Professor Jose to explain him about my project. He understood the limitations and gave me a go ahead to continue with the project. After getting his approval, I am saving images in my database. I am making sure that ALL THE IMAGES THAT ARE USED BY MY PROJECT FALL UNDER CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE and they are free to share,modify for even commercial use. Though my site is non-commercial  , it is good to be on the safer side.

I implemented all the features that Professor Jose suggested me to implement and showed the website to Professor.Of all the features that my website offers, the facility to write on user's wall and like, delete, edit comment/posts on user's wall was the most difficult one to implement. The wall, kind of gives you a feel of the facebook. Made me realize that zuckerberg and his team deserves all the accolades and money that they get for facebook.

Yesterday, I met professor Jose and showed him my project. He looked at it and said that he likes it . Glad to hear that. Now I am concentrating on wrapping up the project and presenting my project properly. 

Last week has been super hectic and fun. Completed 80% of the project. Showed it to professor Jose yesterday and he said that he likes. Glad to hear that.
