<h2>WEEK 7</h2>

<p>This week has been pretty hectic . I have spent almost 3 days researching for a unique yet interesting topic . I have narrowed down 3 topics and am planning to take these 3 topics to Professor on Monday. My First topic is - I noticed that there are lot of Open data posted by the USDA (US Dept of Agriculture) ,Natural Resources ,Geospatial departments. I am planning to combine information from several of these open datasets and build a website that acts as the primary online site/source for any information related to agriculture. However,this is just what I have in mind, the professor may scale up or add a completely new perspective to this idea. As I want my site to serve the community in someway ,so I am keeping the healthcare domain as my second preference. I am planning to build a website that allows users to query for information about drugs, hospital prices, compare hospitals,find details about drugs,check if they are on good health, find physicians etc., . My third project idea is about creating a job portal , as it will help me get to know some companies now which will turn into a value added asset when I head out to search for jobs. Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best </p>
