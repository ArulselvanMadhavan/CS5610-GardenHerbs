<h2>Week 5</h2>

<p>This week we continued exploring MEAN Stack. The interesting part about this week's learning is, to get to know how vast Angular JS really is. This week professor showed us how the MEAN application is architectured in the real world by introducing us to Angular Routing. I've been getting some good ideas around the MEAN application that I have started to build. I am planning to build a NEU course rate application using MEAN Stack. I feel I can get this application to work but still have an area of uncertainty over the new features that I am planning to add.Hopefully, I'll find as much time as I need to complete this application next week.
