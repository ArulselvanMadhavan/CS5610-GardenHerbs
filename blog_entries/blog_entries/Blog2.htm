<h2>Week 4</h2>

<p>This week, we got introduced to yet another awesome web technology called 'nodejs'. Yet another powerful variant of Javascript. As Prof. Jose rightly put it in our class, maybe Javascript is  beginning to conquer the web world. I started doing an experiment in it but refrained from continuing my work on it as I felt that putting nodejs files on our IIS server is not a right thing to do. Since,not having my experiments on our IIS server, would make my experiments unavailable to my TA, I dropped my plans of experimenting on nodejs, THIS WEEK. </p>

<p>Apart from the experiments , this week, I spent quite a lot of time in researching for project topics but haven't been able to 'zero in' on a particular topic. But still I wanted to do something that I will surely implement in my project. So , I thought of experimenting with JSON and extracting data from public APIs. As I write this , I have completed my 3 experiments and I am about to push the files onto the IIS server. </p>

<p> If I have to summarize the overall experience of learning web technology in the past 2 weeks, I've got introduced to lot of technologies with every single one of them piquing the curiosity to learn them in-depth. Hopefully, my project will fill that void and help me master this subject. </p>

<p>Hopefully , by this time , next week , I'd have decided my project title.</p>
