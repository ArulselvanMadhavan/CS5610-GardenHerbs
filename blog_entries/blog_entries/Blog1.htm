<p>After being added as the last member to the Web development course , exactly a week ago, I had a lot to study this week, right from the content that I missed to grasp from the lectures to the assignments that were doubled up for me. This week , has been super hectic, challenging, yet rewarding. Ok, this is exactly what I was told when I decided to go for my graduate degree. So , seems like I am on the right path with the right course. </p>
<p>6 Experiments in a week covering the basics of HTML5,CSS3,Javascript,JQuery and Angular JS. That's a lot. I can hear my seniors saying "You think that's a lot? Wait till they teach you node js,mongo DB,JSON,C#,ASP.NET,ADO.NET etc.," ok, that's a humbling quote, but, still not as humbling as the effect Angular JS had on me today. If I have to pick one among all the other web technologies that I have learned this week, I'd definitely choose Angular. When I started learning about Angular, I was like, "Really? they let you do these things in the client side?" Angular JS appears super powerful to me especially for its ability to behave like stand-alone web application with minimal requests to server. Having said that, I am still in the rudimentary stages of learning Angular JS. But I feel it has thought me a lot than any of these other technologies have. I still have a lot to learn with this cool technology. Hopefully my next set of experiments with Angular JS enthrall me as much as this week's experiment have.</p>
