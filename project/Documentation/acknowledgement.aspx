        First of all , I would like to thank our <i class="inline-heading">Professor. Jose G Annunziato </i> for not just helping us learn some advanced web development concepts but also for inspiring us with his style of teaching and learning.
        I thank Professor Annunziato for bringing my raw project idea into shape. It was his valuable suggestion to include the concept of having a 'wall' for users and letting other users post on them. It was challenging and absolutely rewarding feature to include in my project.
